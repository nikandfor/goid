# goid

This is a simple package that allows you to obtain `goroutine id` in a few machine instructions.

There is no way to obtain `goroutine id` in a language and this is deliberately. Consider other ways to solve your problem not by `goroutine id`.
More info here: https://golang.org/doc/faq#no_goroutine_id

Example is [here](./goid_example_test.go)
